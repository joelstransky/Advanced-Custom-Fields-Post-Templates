# Advanced-Custom-Fields-Post-Templates
Adds the post type template support (since WP 4.7) to Advanced Custom Fields

With WordPress! 4.7, we now have the ability to post types based on 'post'.

Alas, ACF will probably take a bit to support it. But thanks to its excellent filter support you don't have to wait.
Just add the code from `functions.php` into your theme functions or save it by a better name to your plugins folder and activate.
